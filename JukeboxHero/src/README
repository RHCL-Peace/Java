## Sources used

 I used few different sources that were really helpful,

 second was "Luke Bosse P2 intro youtube video and other lessons videos" to get started."
 third was "Luke Bosse examples in posted in blackbored."

 and finally the online source "https://stackoverflow.com/" for help in file parsing and exceptions,
