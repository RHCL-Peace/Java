# Overview

  Create a class that implements the method from GridMonitorInterface 
  and write and test method to test the surrounding cells 
  of the grid and know which one going explode

# INCLUDED FILES:

* GridMonitorTest.java
* GridMonitorInterface.java

## Compilling and Using

To compile the java application, execute the following commond in the main project directory:
```
$  javac GridMonitor.java
```
Run the compile class with the command:
```
$ java GridMonitor
```
## Testing:
GridMonitorTest file was written and given to us
	the testing file was use to test my method and check if 
	they are working correctly
	
## DISCUSSION:
 
the whole project was challenging and I didn't get it done all the way
there few test file I wasn't able to pass 
the method that toke me some time to figure out was "getSurroundingSumGrid" method.
also, I had to look up and recover some in information on 2D Array
